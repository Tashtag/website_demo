	<!-- quick blurb about artist -->
	<p>I started drawing when I was little just like everyone else but I didn't really start getting into it untill grade 7 where I pick up a how to draw book and got hooked.</p>
	<p>Most of my artwork was concept art for a story I started making up, unfortunatly I never finished the story but I really enjoyed making orignial characters and I'm really happy with how far I've come</p>
